## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I have a better understanding of what is expected going into project two week. With the planning and research done for this proposal and the experience from project one, I can plan out my time accordingly to stick to my timeline as closely as possible.

### Weaknesses:

I don't feel totally comfortable creating a React app on my own without class giudance but I am prepared to call upon previous labs, lessons, and homework to build confidence.

### Opportunities:

React has been a challenge in general but I am looking forward to building something on my own and testing what I have comprehended thus far.

### Threats:

I usually try my best to solve issues without asking for help but have learned recently how costly that is time wise during project week.
